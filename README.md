# Urban-Sound-Classification
This is a classification problem and is meant to let me have hands on exposure to audio processing in the usual classification scenario. Compared to other bodily features, voice is dynamic and complex. And voice classification has found useful applications in classifying speakers' gender, mother tongue or ethnicity (accent), emotion states, identity verification, verbal command control, and so forth. Furthermore voice classification potentially can apply to interactive-voice-response system for detecting the moods and tones of customers, thereby guessing if the calls are of complaints or complement, for example. As a consequence, digging into audio data can be beneficial.
